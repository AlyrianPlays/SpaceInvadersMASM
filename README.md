This Space Invaders clone is programmed with MASM x86 assembly language using 32-bit computing. This project aimed to provide the following:

- User-controlled movement with A and D, shooting with spacebar
- AI-controlled enemies with movement and projectiles
- Score-keeping, respawn animation, destructable barriers, etc.
- Fun Fact: code is 1978 lines long, which is the same year Taito initially released the arcade game.  

The technologies explored in this project include:

- Registry editing
